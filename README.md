# Development-Board
This was a board I made in my Digital Logic Systems Lab for class. It was a introduction to how to design a board on Eagle, circuit desigm, soldering, and everything that comes with building an electronic part. I learned a lot from this project and it gave me a lot of insight into the building process of a engineer!
